## *Q2* ##

- Initally every person reaches the stadium in his specified time which i am simulated it using sem_timedwait 

- So after reaching the stadium we have to check all the zones corresponding to his supporting team and if seat is avialable then we have to allocate it.

- Or else we have to make them wait until any seat in his zone becomes empty or his patience time completes.

- This can be done using sem_timedwait. If there is timer intrrupt(the specified time is completed) then sem_timedwait returns -1 or else it will not return -1.

- For every team , we have to check whether the team scored a goal or not according to the probabilty specified in the command.

- So suppose if H scored a goal , then all the members who are supporting to aganist team has to be checked whether thier max_goals becomes equal to total goals scored by H. If the condition is satified then the corresponding person should leave.

- As the person left a seat becomes empty in the zone he previously occupied , so we have to check if there are any persons who are waiting for that zone and correspondingly allocate them seats and signaling them as well so that they can watch match.

- I did the same when the watching time exceeds X (the max time any person can watch a match).
